## 🗓️ New App: Mission — Visualize your goals across time

We’re excited to introduce a new app in OS Yamato: Mission.

This isn’t just a to-do list — it’s a poetic space to **set intentions** and **see them arranged over time**.

✨ **Two unique views:**
- **Year View**: See goals distributed around a 12-month clock
- **Month View**: Focus on goals for the next 31 days

🌸 **Features:**
- Set goals with due dates, importance, emoji, and color
- Visual layout helps you **feel the flow of time**
- Auto-sorting by date keeps your intentions clear and calm

Mission isn’t about pressure.  
It’s about clarity, rhythm, and the quiet momentum of intention.

Now available in the latest OS Yamato update.

✨ Now Open

After two and a half months of quiet, steady growth, OS Yamato has opened its gates to the world.
This isn’t just software — it’s a philosophy of impermanence, care, and simplicity.

⸻

🌿 Philosophy

We believe digital memories, like real ones, shouldn’t last forever by default.

OS Yamato invites you to experience a mindful, seasonal digital space:
	•	No hoarding
	•	No clutter
	•	Just meaningful moments

🕊️ Notes, photos, and messages gently fade if left untouched — and disappear after a year.

⸻

🖼️ How It Works
	•	Each data object (note, photo, contact…) includes a lastOpenedAt timestamp.
	•	After 330 days, it shows a 🥀 icon — a sign of digital wilting.
	•	After 365 days, it’s automatically deleted.

Let it return to the wind.

⸻
