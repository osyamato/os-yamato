✨ Now Open

After two and a half months of quiet, steady growth, OS Yamato has opened its gates to the world.
This isn’t just software — it’s a philosophy of impermanence, care, and simplicity.

⸻

🌿 Philosophy

We believe digital memories, like real ones, shouldn’t last forever by default.
<<<<<<< HEAD
OS Yamato invites you to experience a mindful, seasonal digital space:
	•	No hoarding.
	•	No clutter.
	•	Just meaningful moments.

Notes, photos, and messages gently fade if left untouched — and disappear after a year.

🖼️ How It Works
	•	Each data object (note, photo, contact…) includes a lastOpenedAt timestamp.
<<<<<<< HEAD
	•	After 330 days unopened, it shows a 🥀 icon as a sign of wilting.
	•	After 365 days, it is automatically deleted — returning to the wind.
