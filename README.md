✨ Now Open

After two and a half months of quiet, steady growth, OS Yamato has opened its gates to the world.
This isn’t just software — it’s a philosophy of impermanence, care, and simplicity.

⸻

🌿 Philosophy

We believe digital memories, like real ones, shouldn’t last forever by default.

OS Yamato invites you to experience a mindful, seasonal digital space:
	•	No hoarding
	•	No clutter
	•	Just meaningful moments

🕊️ Notes, photos, and messages gently fade if left untouched — and disappear after a year.

⸻

🖼️ How It Works
	•	Each data object (note, photo, contact…) includes a lastOpenedAt timestamp.
	•	After 330 days, it shows a 🥀 icon — a sign of digital wilting.
	•	After 365 days, it’s automatically deleted.

Let it return to the wind.

⸻

Let it bloom.
